## 🌟 Core App Features

### 1. Dashboard Overview & Budgeting
* **Remaining Budget Tracker**: A high-visibility progress indicator showing spent vs. remaining funds relative to your selected budget period (Weekly, Monthly, or Custom range).
* **Dynamic Spending Trends**: A smooth, interactive 7-day spending line chart to visualize cash outflows.
* **Quick Spend Hub**: Horizontal scrolling category shortcuts (Food, Shopping, Travel, Bills, etc.) to log standard transactions with a single tap.
* **Quick Insights**: Smart cards highlighting spend alerts, budget overruns, and general saving advice.

### 2. Multi-Account & Wallet System
* **Custom Wallets**: Create and manage distinct accounts representing Cash, Bank Accounts, Credit Cards, or Savings Accounts.
* **Personalized Cards**: Assign custom names, type icons, bank names, starting balances, and color hexes to match your physical cards.
* **Inter-Account Transfers**: Record fund transfers between wallets (e.g., ATM withdrawals, credit card payments), automatically recalculating both account balances.
* **Net Balance Exclusions**: Toggle accounts (like high-yield savings) to be excluded from your primary dashboard "Total Balance".

### 3. Smart Transaction Logging
* **Math Calculator Keyboard**: Write equations directly in the amount field (e.g., `250 + 120 * 1.05`) with a live calculation preview before saving.
* **Transaction Types**: Label logs as **Expense** (reduces wallet balance) or **Income** (adds to wallet balance).

### 4. Planned Transactions & Recurring Expenses
* **Subscription & Bill Scheduler**: Automate recurring cycles (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly) or schedule one-time future payments.
* **Overdue Highlights**: Highlights upcoming or missed expenses on your dashboard in red.
* **Auto-Deposit Income**: Scheduled income transactions (like salaries) are automatically deposited in the background on their due date, without requiring manual interaction.
* **Pay / Skip Actions**: For scheduled expenses, tap **Pay** to manually log the transaction to its wallet and schedule the next cycle, or tap **Skip** to advance the schedule without logging a transaction.

### 5. Debts & Receivables
* **Lending & Borrowing Ledger**: Track debts (what you owe) and dues (what others owe you) with person names and due dates.
* **Integrated Settlement**: Record full or partial repayments with a toggle to automatically post corresponding income/expense transactions in your ledger.

### 6. Ledger & History Controls
* **Search & Grouping**: Search logs by title, category, or tag. Group records by Week, Month, or Year with calculated subtotals.
* **Advanced Filters**: Filter lists by transaction type, category, date range (with custom calendar ranges), and sorting order.
* **Visual Badges**: Every transaction card displays its category icon, associated wallet label (in its custom color), and tag chips.

### 7. Privacy, Security & Portability
* **Privacy Masking Toggle**: Hide balances and income on the dashboard and logs (displayed as `••••`) when using the app in public.
* **Biometric Lock**: Protect sensitive financial records with secure fingerprint or face unlock.
* **Data Portability**: Export your transaction ledger to JSON or CSV, or import external files to restore backups.

## 💡 Guidelines to Achieve 100% Efficiency

Follow these best practices to get maximum utility and automation out of your personal finance tracker:

### 1. Map Out All Wallets and Start Balances
Do not use the app as a single "Cash" ledger. Create separate wallets for your physical cash, payroll bank account, credit card, and savings. By tracking inter-account transfers (like credit card payments or cash withdrawals), your net worth calculations remain accurate without throwing off your category-based budgets.

### 2. Automate Constant Expenses with Scheduled Cycles
Schedule your fixed bills, recurring subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, gym), and salary dates under **Planned Transactions**. Instead of manual entry, you will receive overdue indicators for expenses on your dashboard. Tapping **Pay** instantly logs them with the correct wallet, category, and amount, cutting down log times by 90%. Scheduled incomes like salary will automatically deposit in the background without needing your attention.

### 4. Use the Amount Calculator for Shared Expenses
When buying items in bulk or splitting bills, use the math evaluator inside the amount field (e.g., `4500 / 3` or `1200 + 450 + 900`). This eliminates the need to switch back and forth between a separate calculator app and the tracker.

### 5. Align Budget Cycles to Your Payroll
If you get paid on a non-calendar schedule (e.g., every 15th of the month or bi-weekly), set a **Custom Budget Period** instead of the default calendar month. This aligns your "Remaining Balance" directly with your active cash flow, ensuring you don't overspend during the final week of a cycle.

### 6. Toggle Privacy Mode in Public
Keep the **Hide Balance** and **Hide Income** toggles enabled in Settings. This allows you to log transactions on the go in public transport, restaurants, or cafes without revealing your net worth or monthly earnings to shoulder-surfers.

### 7. Bridge Debt Repayment to Your Ledger
When clearing debts in the Debts section, always keep the **Log as Transaction** toggle checked. This automatically adjusts your account balances and updates your budget records so that debt settlements are accounted for in your monthly savings rate.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

The application is built on top of robust Android development frameworks and architecture guidelines:
* **Language**: 100% Kotlin
* **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose for declarative and smooth UI rendering
* **Architecture Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) separating logic, UI state, and database operations
* **Reactive Streams**: StateFlow and Coroutines for lifecycle-aware asynchronously updated UI data
* **Local Persistence**: SQLite database wrapper utilizing Room DB (Schema Version `4`)
* **Security**: Android Biometric Library for hardware-level secure lockscreen implementation
* **Excel/PDF Generation**: Apache POI for spreadsheet handling, and Android native `PdfDocument` for lightweight PDF creation without external library bloat
